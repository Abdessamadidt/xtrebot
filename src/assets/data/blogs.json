        "content": "<p>Despite the belief of many crypto enthusiasts that centralized exchanges (CEXs) are safer, history has often shown them to be rather vulnerable to attacks.</p><br><p>Because these exchanges centralize the storage of users’ assets, they can be attractive targets for cybercriminals. If an exchange’s security measures are inadequate or successfully compromised, user assets may be stolen or lost.</p><br><p>Another risk of centralized exchanges is the potential for fraud or mismanagement by their operators. CEXs may have a single point of control — leaving them more susceptible to insider fraud or other forms of misconduct — which can lead to the loss of funds or other negative consequences for users.</p><br><p>Over the last year, the collapse of major centralized cryptocurrency platforms like FTX and Celsius has led to more users choosing to take self-custody of their digital assets. The risky financial practices and alleged fraud committed at some platforms have caused many people to lose faith in them as safe places to store their cryptocurrency.</p><br><p>Self-custody refers to holding and managing one’s cryptocurrency instead of entrusting it to a third party, such as an exchange. This approach offers users greater control over their assets and can potentially provide higher levels of security. However, it also comes with its risks, particularly in scams.</p><br><p><br></p><br><p><strong>Types of scams and how to avoid them</strong></p><br><p>To better understand the potential dangers associated with self-custody and offer guidance on how to protect oneself from scams, XonBIT reached out to Alice Boucher of Chainabuse — a multichain community platform for reporting fraudulent crypto transactions.</p><br><p>One scam aiming to take advantage of crypto users is called “pig butchering.”</p><br><p>“A pig butchering scam occurs when the scammer stays in constant contact to build a relationship with the victim and ‘fatten them up’ with affection over time to have them invest in fake projects,” Boucher said, adding:</p><br><p>“The scammer tries to drain as much money out of the victim as possible, often using fake investment sites showing large fake profits and using social engineering tactics, such as intimidation, to extract more money from the victim.”</p><br><p>Social engineering uses psychological manipulation tactics to exploit the natural tendencies of human trust and curiosity.</p><br><p>Cybercriminals in the cryptocurrency industry often aim to steal self-held assets by taking control of high-profile accounts. “Between May and August 2022, social media account takeovers involving Twitter, Discord and Telegram have wreaked havoc. Scammers post malicious nonfungible token (NFT) phishing links during those attacks, compromising high-profile social media accounts,” Boucher said.</p><br><p>Once these attackers have gained access to a high-profile account, they typically use it to send out phishing messages and other malicious communications to many people, attempting to trick them into giving up their private keys, login credentials or other sensitive information.</p><br><p>The end goal is to gain access to the victims' assets in self-custody and steal the cryptocurrency held by the individual.</p><br><p>Followers of these high-profile accounts may be tricked into clicking on malicious links that transfer the tokens from their wallets. These scams may also be designed to have users invest on a trading platform, often resulting in victims losing their deposits with no way to recover them. Boucher added:</p><br><p>“The volume of scams, hacks, blackmails and other fraudulent activity has been growing exponentially over the last few years. Most fake platforms appear to be either Ponzi schemes or payout scams with the following characteristics: They advertise fake returns, have referral incentives that resemble pyramid schemes or impersonate existing legitimate trading platforms.”</p><br><p>Scammers utilizing these phishing tactics can encourage users to sign smart contracts that drain their assets without their consent. A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into the code.</p><br><p>Users may lose their tokens if the contract contains errors or is designed to take advantage of people. For example, if it allows its creator to take possession of tokens to sell them, users may lose cryptocurrency by signing it.</p><br><p>Most of the time, users don’t know they’ve lost their tokens until it is too late.</p>",

        "content": " <p>Stablecoin regulation is one of the most controversial topics in cryptocurrency. Recent reports from U.S. regulators as well as the Biden Administration have warned that stablecoins could threaten financial stability, although many are skeptical of that claim. Previous proposals sought to regulate transparency, issuance, and licensing of stablecoins, although no legislation has yet been passed.</p><br><p>This debate, however, may be missing an important point: The issuance of redeemable notes by private banks, in paper or electronic form, appears to already be legal in the United States.</p><br><p>Thomas Hogan is a senior fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research. He was formerly the chief economist for the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, &amp; Urban Affairs. </p><br><p>Private banknotes were widely used as a medium of exchange for the majority of U.S. history. Prior to the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913, banks issued paper notes redeemable for the equivalent amount of some asset, usually gold. Even after the end of the gold standard in 1933, notes issued by national banks continued to circulate, dwindling to around $20 million in circulation by 1970.</p><br><p>Private banknote issuance is common practice in several countries today. In Hong Kong, Scotland and Northern Ireland, for example, private banks issue paper notes redeemable for their own local currencies. Private bank-issued currency is legal in dozens of countries around the world.</p><br><p>Electronic stablecoins are the modern analog to paper banknotes. Stablecoins are crypto tokens whose value is tied to some other asset, such as the U.S. dollar. The total market value of the top four U.S. dollar-linked stablecoins is currently around $135 billion, which although quite large, is modest compared to the U.S. monetary base of about $5.4 trillion.</p><br><p>Most stablecoins are redeemable on demand, just like deposits in a checking or savings account. Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, promises redeemability in U.S. dollars. Some stablecoins, such as the dai (DAI) token, require more than 100% collateralization to help ensure token holders’ funds are secure even if the collateral value falls.</p>",

        "image": "assets/blogs/blog2.png",
        "date": "Jan 22nd 2023",
        "content": "<p>Regulators are in no hurry to write rules for crypto. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have brought a combined total of more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto-asset market participants. Yet, neither agency has issued a single crypto-specific rule, and it is unlikely that they will change course any time soon. But what if the agencies decided to do so? What sorts of rules could they write using their existing regulatory authorities?</p><br><p><br></p><br><p><strong>The SEC</strong></p><br><p>Federal securities laws are principally designed to reduce information asymmetries between the issuers of securities and the investing public. When a firm elects to raise capital from investors by selling a security, the laws require the firm to make investor disclosures to minimize the informational disadvantage of outside investors. Additionally, the laws require exchanges, brokers, dealers and investment advisers who provide access to securities or securities-related advice to register with the SEC and adopt policies and procedures designed to protect investors.</p><br><p>Michael Selig is counsel at Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher.</p><br><p>The framers of the federal securities laws didn't have programmable crypto assets in mind when they drafted the laws. But the SEC has the statutory authority to issue rules that would make it possible for crypto assets and crypto intermediaries to operate within the contours of federal securities laws. The agency could start by writing rules to establish a workable framework for crypto-asset security issuances and exchanges.</p><br><p><br></p><br><p><strong>Issuances</strong></p><br><p>Crypto assets are network assets. Unlike firms, networks are generative. The value of a network derives from the applications, organizations and projects built on the network by its users. The developer of a network may opt to issue the network’s native crypto asset when publicly available information about the network is scarce to encourage users to join the network. Once a critical mass of users has joined and is participating in a network, the developer may no longer have an informational advantage relative to the users. At this point, investors in the crypto asset may not require the protections of federal securities laws.</p><br><p>It is unlawful to offer or sell a security without registering the offering or sale with the SEC, absent an exemption. The definition of the term “security” includes a list of financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, notes and investment contracts. Crypto assets most typically come within scope of federal securities laws when sold as part of an investment contract.</p><br><p>The term investment contract originates from “blue sky” laws designed to govern offerings of written contracts under which a person invests money with a promoter who promises to use the money to generate profits for the investor. In a 1946 opinion (giving rise to the so-called Howey Test), the U.S. Supreme Court defined the term “investment contract” for purposes of federal securities laws as a contract, transaction or scheme whereby an investor invests money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.</p><br><p>There is little mention of investment contracts in the SEC rules because before crypto assets came along, nobody knowingly intended to issue them. For decades, the SEC has brought lawsuits asserting that a contract, transaction or scheme should remedially be classified as an investment contract because it has the economic substance of a security. After the SEC started to bring these lawsuits against crypto-asset issuers, some crypto projects embraced the investment contract designation and attempted to issue these instruments in compliance with federal securities laws.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Despite its recent issues, Bitcoin’s success and growing visibility since its launch has resulted in a number of companies unveiling alternative cryptocurrencies, such as:</p><ul><li>Litecoin – Litecoin is regarded as Bitcoin's leading rival at present, and it is designed for processing smaller transactions faster. It was founded in October 2011 as ”a coin that is silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” according to founder Charles Lee. Unlike the heavy computer horsepower required for Bitcoin mining, Litecoins can be mined by a normal desktop computer. Litecoin’s maximum limit is 84 million – four times Bitcoin’s 21-million limit – and it has a transaction processing time of about 2.5 minutes, about one-fourth that of Bitcoin.</li><li>Ripple – Ripple was launched by OpenCoin, a company founded by technology entrepreneur Chris Larsen in 2012. Like Bitcoin, Ripple is both a currency and a payment system. The currency component is XRP, which has a mathematical foundation like Bitcoin. The payment mechanism enables the transfer of funds in any currency to another user on the Ripple network within seconds, in contrast to Bitcoin transactions, which can take as long as 10 minutes to confirm.</li><li>MintChip – Unlike most cryptocurrencies, MintChip is actually the creation of a government institution, specifically the Royal Canadian Mint. MintChip is a smartcard that holds electronic value and can transfer it securely from one chip to another. Like Bitcoin, MintChip does not need personal identification; unlike Bitcoin, it is backed by a physical currency, the Canadian dollar.</li></ul>",
